[Flutter Official Site][flutterdev] clone using Flutter Web. Try the live site [here][live-link]. For the time being its not responsive fully so there might be issues considering the layout on your screen.

*Reload the `live link` in case few images doesn't load*

### 📝 Note
- For the opening animation. For the time being there is only one animating design. Will work with others and add them soon
- I have used [url_launcher][url-launcher] package for linking the page with other link as in the original home page
- Considering the `Try flutter in your browser` it is just a simple `TextField`. Don't try to compile the code :p

## 🔴 What can be improved

In case you want to contribute, please feel free to create pull request :)

- Adding all animation design in the opening panel i.e. `Design beautiful app` animation
- Making the page responsive
- Adding missing `URL` using the same package (Will do it soon)
